# Weather-App
With this project, one will be building a weather app that makes API calls, which is an essential skill for React project development.

We can also display real-time weather information for a user's location, which is a great way to practice working with external data. To get this, youâ€™ll use the browser's built-in Geolocation API.
Babel Plugin has been discontinued, hence deployment could not be initialized. 

This project is better created using VITE, for more functionality and smooth deployment.
The source code can easily be modified and would run smoothly in  React-Vite.
